# Kf Buildpacks

This repository held the initial Cloud Native Buildpacks [`kf`](https://github.com/google/kf) used.

Cloud Native Buildpacks have now matured to the point where this respository isn't going to be maintained going forward.

Instead, we recommend you use a the Heroku or Cloud Foundry Cloud Native Buildpack for your existing applications:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudfoundry/cnb
* https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/buildpacks
